You’ve awaken as a cube in a world with domino tiles falling from the sky, being chased by this ominous black cube for reasons unknown. All you can do is run. For some reason you know that the black cube must never catch you. You also know that, when you go past the double value domino tiles you gain power-ups that help you run better.

Suddenly a vision, “Get all seven keys to open the door…”

## Components:
1 Set of dominoes,
4 Six-sided dice,
1 Black Cube, 1 White Cube
## Setup:
Shuffle dominoes into a face down draw pile. Take 2 starting dice. Draw and place 5 domino tiles following 
the Tile placement rule:
Connect the tile with its matching space to the end of the previous tile to form a line. 
If unable, orient the tile to position the lower of the two values instead whether starting 
the line or connect to a non-matching existing tile. (Example: in the domino track as illustrated above the 0:5 tile followed the low to high orientation connecting with the 2:4, while the 5:1 connected its 5 to 5:0 tile since it matched.)
        Mulligan: At the start of the game you may draw a new set of tiles if you wish and return the rest.
Place the black cube at the starting space of the line. Count 5 spaces from there and place the player’s white cube.
## Turn Structure:
1.	Roll: Player rolls their dice.

2.	Move: Move the white by paying the pip costs of one or more tile spaces in front of them. Use values on each dice in any order to pay for the movement cost.

a.	If they are unable to fully pay the next space they must stop on their current space.

b.	Moving through an empty space does not consume pips.

c.	Once per turn you may combine two unused dice values to use for movement.

d.	Whenever they pass a double value tile, they remove it from the line and collect it as a key. Keys also unlock a treasure of their choice:

i.	Bonus Dice: Gain a new dice to add to their next roll.

ii.	Bonus Ability: Draw until you find a non-double non-empty spaced tile from the pile and put it in front of the player face-up. Return the rest of the tiles drawn this way face-down. This tile allows the player once per turn to convert a die face of the lower value to the higher value.

3.	Enemy: Move X spaces towards the player cube, where X = 2 + the number of keys the player controls. Whenever the enemy land on a spot where treasure was removed from, they end their movement for the turn. They can move into the nearest available tile space next turn as normal.

Damage: If the enemy catches reaches the player’s space and the player has a treasure, 

they sacrifice one treasure and return it back to its source. Move back the enemy to the start of the line. If they are unable to sacrifice a treasure they lose the game.

4.	Cleanup: Remove all tiles behind the Enemy cube and return it face down to the draw pile. Draw and place tiles in front of the line ‘til X tiles are in front of the player cube where X = 2 + the number of keys the player controls.


## Victory: If the player controls all 7 keys they have won the game.
